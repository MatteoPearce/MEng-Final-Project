## Introduction
My name is Matteo Pearce and I am a MEng Electronic Engineering with Nanotechnology graduate from the University of York with work experience at Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains. 

This repository showcases my final project completed during my master's year at the University of York.

## Abstract
Random search exploration in Python of system parameters for thin ferromagnetic films (Co, Fe, Ni), simulated with the Vampire atomistic simulator and used as reservoirs according to the Reservoir Computing machine learning paradigm. Properties such as Gilbert magnetic damping and parameters such as input scaling, film dimensions and readout discretisation are trialled in different combinations to assess the effects on NRMSE in predicting the NARMA10 algorithm, injected into the film as a z-component magnetic field intensity. An appraisal of the compatibility of this technology with biomagnetic signals as a feasibility study into the application of such films for in-situ biosensors. Exploration of novel implementations such as body-temperature test conditions, equal input scaling and uniform signal injection are trialled as cornerstone concepts for the suggested use-case, with the latter constituting a significant roadblock. Film dimensions emerge as a clear strategy for mitigating errors, and pico-Tesla signals display good compatibility with the ferromagnetic mediums.
